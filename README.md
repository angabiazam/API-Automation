https://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/hourly?q=London,us&appid=b6907d289e10d714a6e88b30761fae22

The above API is the REST GET API Which gives you the response in JSON format and hourly weather forecast of London Location

I want you to automate the below test cases for all the available data
1. Is the response contains 4 days of data
2. Is all the forecast in the hourly interval ( no hour should be missed )
3. For all 4 days, the temp should not be less than temp_min and not more than temp_max
4. If the weather id is 500, the description should be light rain
5. If the weather id is 800, the description should be a clear sky
